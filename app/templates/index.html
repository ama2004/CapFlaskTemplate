    <h2 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>STEM Gap</strong></h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;">The STEM gap is the underrepresentation of women and minority groups
        in STEM.</p>

    <!-- Subtopics -->
    
    <h5 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>Sexism, racism, stereotypes in STEM</strong></h5>
    <div class="column">
    <img src="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2021/03/R2103J_BAGNARELLI.jpg" width="350" height="250"
        style="float: right;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;" style="float: left;">Women and people of color experience discrimination, especially
        exployment discrimination + work discrimination when
        pursuing STEM. Among those in STEM, 72% of blacks say a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are
        underrepresented
        in these jobs is because they face
        discrimination in recruiting. Among those experiences, some 45% of black STEM workers say that they have had
        someone
        treat them as not competent because of their race. Many women and minorities face negative stereotypes and
        expectations creating more pressure
        for them. Research indicates that both women and people of color are more likely to report discrimination,
        microaggressions, and harassment in STEM.

    <h5 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>Income Difference in STEM Jobs</strong></h5>
    <div class="column">

        style="float: right;" width="350" height="250">
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;" style="float: left;">Generally, women are paid less than men in STEM jobs, but there are
        some exceptions. Wages aren't only related to
        workplace issues. An example of this is when women with children are shown to have higher wages than women who
        do
        not because women with high earning potential are able to balance family and work life.

    <h5 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>Education in STEM</strong></h5>
    <div class="column">
    <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202111/learn-1996846_1280_1200x768.jpeg?X.ihlRIQatesARSN.ktjtipyo3ASIQgD&size=770:433"
        width="350" height="250" style="float: right;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;" style="float: left;">Sometimes it is not the lack of STEM education
        that is causing people to not consider STEM. Some people are just not
        that interested in STEM. Some are but were encouraged by others, such as academic advisors, to pursue non-STEM
        related majors. It could also be that there are some underfunded schools that lacks STEM education.
        Microaggressions
        towards women
        and people of color in college and the workplace, which can be race, gender, and possibly even sexual
        orientation.
        An example would be being asked to do other tasks that are not related to their job responsibilities.
    </p>
</div>


    <h5 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h5>
    <div class="column">
    <img src="https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2020/02/people-computers-50-50_900x700_acf_cropped.png" width="400"
        height="250" style="float: right;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;" style="float: left;">Closing the STEM gap matters because these factors can create less
        diversity in STEM due to the
        pressure created and more people would drop out from STEM because they feel out place because of their race and
        gender. This makes the experience not welcoming to people who are underrepresented in STEM.
        This means that girls, women, and people of color are less likely to stay in STEM and pursue other non-STEM
        careers.

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;"><strong>Benefits to STEM</strong></h2>
<div class="column">
    <img src="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stem-day.jpg" style="float: right;" width="350"
        height="250">
    <p style="font-family: 'Hina Mincho', serif;" style="float: left;">Having a strong foundation in STEM offers a lot of benefits. It helps
        develop your critical thinking
        and communication skills. It also improves the individual's confidence and competence when they know how to
        solve a
        problem. STEM classes can help prepare people real application of those skills for not only STEM careers, but
        careers in other sectors. They allow students to experiment and experience failures, which can then help build
        resilience. The skills learned in STEM can be used in other subjects and in an interdisciplinary way. </p>
