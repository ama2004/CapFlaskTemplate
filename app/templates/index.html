<h2>STEM Gap</h2>
<p>The STEM gap is the underrepresentation of women and minority groups in STEM.</p>

<h5>Sexism, racism, stereotypes in STEM</h5>
<p>Women and people of color experience discrimination, especially exployment discrimination + work discrimination when
    pursuing STEM. Among those in STEM, 72% of blacks say a major reason why blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented
    in these jobs is because they face
    discrimination in recruiting. Among those experiences, some 45% of black STEM workers say that they have had someone
    treat them as not competent because of their race. Many women and minorities face negative stereotypes and
    expectations creating more pressure
    for them. Research indicates that both women and people of color are more likely to report discrimination,
    microaggressions, and harassment in STEM.
</p>

<h5>Income Difference in STEM Jobs</h5>
<p>Generally, women are paid less than men in STEM jobs, but there are some exceptions. Wages aren't only related to
    workplace issues. An example of this is when women with children are shown to have higher wages than women who do
    not because women with high earning potential are able to balance family and work life.
</p>

<h5>Education in STEM</h5>
<p>Sometimes it is not the lack of STEM education that is causing people to not consider STEM. Some people are just not
    that interested in STEM. Some are but were encouraged by others, such as academic advisors, to pursue non-STEM
    related majors. It could also be that there are some underfunded schools that lacks STEM education. Microaggressions
    towards women
    and people of color in college and the workplace, which can be race, gender, and possibly even sexual orientation.
    An example would be being asked to do other tasks that are not related to their job responsibilities.
</p>

<h5>Why does it matter?</h5>
<p>Closing the STEM gap matters because these factors can create less diversity in STEM due to the
    pressure created and more people would drop out from STEM because they feel out place because of their race and
    gender. This makes the experience not welcoming to people who are underrepresented in STEM.
    This means that girls, women, and people of color are less likely to stay in STEM and pursue other non-STEM careers.

<h2>Benefits to STEM</h2>
<img src="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stem-day.jpg" width="300" height="250">

<p>Having a strong foundation in STEM offers a lot of benefits. It helps develop your critical thinking
    and communication skills. It also improves the individual's confidence and competence when they know how to solve a
    problem. STEM classes can help prepare people real application of those skills for not only STEM careers, but
    careers in other sectors. They allow students to experiment and experience failures, which can then help build
    resilience. The skills learned in STEM can be used in other subjects and in an interdisciplinary way. </p>
